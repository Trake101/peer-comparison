<h5>Q. How can I share the comparison group I've created?</h5>
<p>
  Once you have successfully created a comparison group, click the "Permalink Comparison" button and you will be re-directed to a page which you can share with others. This link will never expire, but the institutions may change as we load newer institutional data into our database.

<p>
  You can click the 'Review Comparison Groups' on the left navigation, <%=link_to "browse", comparisons_path%> and search all of the comparison groups which have been created in the past or you can simply <%=link_to "re-create", root_path%> the comparison group!

<p>
  We have provided two means for using the comparison group data. First, have you have created a comparison group, you can export the result set to CSV by clicking the 
    <%=link_to('#', :class => "btn btn-default") do%>
      <span class="icon-file"></span> Download</a>
    <%end%>
   button. Second, if you are a developer, or familiar with other modern APIs, you can export the data using our <%=link_to "API", api_path%>. This will provide access to our backend processing and return a comparison group in the standard JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format.
